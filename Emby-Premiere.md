An Emby Premiere subscription allows you to enjoy additional features in both the server and Emby-provided apps.  Some apps provide individual unlocks for basic functionality but only Emby Premiere allows you to experience the full array of features in both the server and Emby apps.

Emby Premiere is attached to your server by [entering a key](Premiere-Key-Delivery.md).  The features are tied to this key, not any particular "account".  So, anyone who connects to your server will enjoy the benefits of Premiere (within the specified [limits](Premiere-Limits.md) of your subscription) and will also count towards your device limits.  **Note** - If you are connected to someone else's server, then it is the Premiere status of that server that governs the available features.

For more information on the features of Emby Premiere as well as the purchase options, please see the web site [Emby Premiere page](https://emby.media/premiere.html).

For more information on what is offered by Emby Premiere vs. the individual app unlocks (available only in some apps), please see: [Emby Premiere Feature Matrix](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Emby-Premiere-Feature-Matrix).
