Support for gamepad input has been significantly updated. On the technical side, unnecessary power drain is avoided and the reliability of key input detection has been improved. Functionally, mappings have been extended, allowing to control more things with game pad buttons.

The new settings UI serves two purposes:

- It provides an overview over the functions assigned to individual gamepad buttons and sticks
- It allows to test all controls as to whether they are recognized by the app
