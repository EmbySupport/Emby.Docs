Support for remote control input has been extended. More button mappings are supported, including all buttons found on classic Windows Media Center remotes (Windows app). The Xbox app supports a smaller set of RC buttons only.

The new settings UI allows to test all remote control buttons as to whether they are recognized by the app.
