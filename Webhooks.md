Do you love home automation? With Emby Premiere you can setup webhooks. Emby can dim the lights when you start a movie, or send a tweet after you finish watching an episode of your favorite TV show.

A webhook (also called a web callback or HTTP push API) is a way for an app to provide other applications with real-time information. 

A webhook delivers data to other applications as it happens, meaning you get data immediately. Examples uses would be to setup Zapier or IFTTT and have the Emby webhooks feature connect to those applications. Once Zapier or IFTTT receives the notification, then you can configure it to perform certain actions based on that. Examples of actions could be to connect to your home automation equipment and do certain things like dim the lights, or send notifications to your phones, or send notifications to just about anything you want.
