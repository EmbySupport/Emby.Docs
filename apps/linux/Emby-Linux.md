# Emby Linux

[!INCLUDE [beta-warning](../../includes/beta-warning.md)]


We're excited to provide an all-new Emby Linux app, built to deliver the best possible media playback experience on Linux desktops.

### Goals of the native Linux App

While the Emby web app works well across platforms, there are limits to what a browser-based player can achieve, especially when it comes to modern video and audio playback.  
Browsers continue to improve, but they inevitably lag behind native applications when it comes to advanced video technologies, hardware acceleration, and reliable fullscreen playback. Emby users expect smooth, high-quality playback — and delivering that consistently requires a native application.

### Benefits Over the Web Player
The new Linux app provides several advantages over watching through a browser:

- More reliable video playback with fewer browser-related limitations
- Better performance and lower system overhead
- Improved fullscreen behavior across Linux desktop environments
- Direct integration with native video playback technologies
- A cleaner, distraction free viewing experience

By separating video playback from the browser entirely, the app is able to take full advantage of the system and deliver a smoother experience.


# Download and Installation

Emby Linux is currently in beta. There is no stable version available yet.
