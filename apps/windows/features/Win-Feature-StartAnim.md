### Can the animation be disabled?

There's a "Hide" button at the bottom right which allows you to hide the animation and see what's behind. On fast systems and when you're already logged into to a specific server, you may gain 2 seconds by doing so, but no more and at the cost of seeing some ugly display changes. And not always.
