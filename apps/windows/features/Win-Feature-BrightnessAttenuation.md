# Brightness Attenuation

The new Windows app has a brightness attenuation control which allows to reduce the brightness of UI elements without affecting the colors and brightness of video playback.
This feature is the first of its kind in Emby, meant to test what can be done in this area.

> [!NOTE]
> For technical reasons this is currently limited to the Windows theme only!
