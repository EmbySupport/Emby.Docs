# Accessibility Features: Hight Contrast Theme and Keyboard Navigation

The new Windows app is the first Emby client app, providing accessibility features for user interaction, specifically:

- Support for Windows High Contrast themes
- Enhanced support for keyboard navigation in desktop (non-TV) mode
  - Proper drawing of item focus indicators according to the Windows UI guidelines
  - Improved navigation with arrow keys  
    (sometimes the use of TAB or SHIFT+TAB is required, which is normal though for Windows applications)

## Prerequisites

The "Windows" theme must be enabled in the Emby app
No app theme override (dark/light) may be configured
(see the "Windows Theme" post above)

## How to...

- **...enable a high contrrast theme for the Emby app?**  
  Prerequisites need to be fulfilled, then the app will automatically follow the OS level theme settings (including high contrast themes)
