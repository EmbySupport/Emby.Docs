# Brightness Attentuation

The new Windows app has a brightness attentuation control which allows to reduce the brightness of UI elements without affecting the colors and brightness of video playback.
This feature is the first of its kind in Emby, meant to test what can be done in this area.

> [!NOTE]
> For technical reasons this is currently limited to the Windows theme only!

## How to...

- **...enable the brightness attentuation feature?**  
  Go to Settings (Gear icon), in the left sidebar choose "Display", find setting "Theme" and make sure that "Windows" is select. Then hit the "Theme Settings" buttons below and use the dropdown selection to control the brightness attentuation strength  
  Notes: Changes are applied instantly; "Minimal" attentuation is very subtle
