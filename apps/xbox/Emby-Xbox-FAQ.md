### I am changing the subtitle style settings, but it doesn't seem that they have any effect.

There can be multiple reasons for this:

- The subtitles are "graphic" subtitles.
  The appearance of those cannot be changed.
  Typical subtitle formats using bitmaps are: DVDSub DVBSub, PGS/HDMV Subtitles
- The subtitles are SSA/ASS subtitles
  Those subtitles have built-in stylingwhich cannot be overridden

- System Settings may take precedence
  To fix this, go to Xbox Accessibiliy settings and look for **Captions**. Disable all settings there.



### The start animation is nice, but it takes a long time and the previous Xbox app was starting up faster, can the animation be disabled?

While the animation is running, you can click on the "Hide" button in the bottom right corner of the window. You will see, though, that this doesn't accelerate startup. In fact, it is not that the app is waiting for the animation to finish, instead, the animation is only there to sweeten up the startup experience instead of just showing a spinning circle for the same duration.
