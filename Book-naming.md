This file naming guide applies to books, both electronic and audio books.

### Library Setup

When setting up the library, make sure to select **Books** as the content type.

### Supported Media Types

For electronic books, the following types are supported:

* pdf
* epub
* mobi
* cbr
* cbz
* azw3

For audio books, the all of the same audio formats from [music libraries](Music-naming) are also supported.

### File Naming

When setting up the library, make sure to select **Books** as the content type.
For **books**, it is recommended to have only the **title** and **year**, followed by the extension. To improve matching add the year within parenthesis to the end of the file or folder name (before the extension, if file name). This naming standard will generally yield the best results.

Examples:

```
\Books\Pulp Fiction (1994).pdf
