## What does Emby Connect do?

Emby Connect is a free optional service that allows a person to use one set of username/password credentials when accessing Emby's Forums and Community as well as any Emby Server's setup for you to login using Emby Connect.

#### Does This Mean My Streaming is Passing Through the Cloud?

No, all connections are direct from your devices to your Emby Server. The sole purpose of the Emby Connect feature is to help your devices locate your Emby Server so that you don't have to set it up yourself.

## User Guide

Start by signing up for Emby Connect. Once you have your Emby Connect account it can be given to any Emby admin who will add it to your account on their system.
