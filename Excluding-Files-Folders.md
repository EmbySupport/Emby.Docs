To exclude a folder from the library scan, simply mark it hidden, or place a file inside the folder named .ignore

This will cause Emby to ignore all subfolders as well.

> [!NOTE]
> that this is intended to ignore folders with media in the library.  Some metadata sub-folders within a media item (like a movie or series) may not currently support this .ignore feature.
