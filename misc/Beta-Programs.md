# Emby Beta Programs

We offer beta testing programs for a range of products. The ways how these are being carried out can vary in a number of ways. In order to document the status and conditions of those programs, we are providing specification tables in the documentation.  
Below are the description of the individual parameters being used.


## Description of Program Specifications

### Program Status

- **Unavailable**  
  No beta program exists, and none is currently planned.
- **Planned**
  We intend to establish a beta program.
- **Starting soon**  
  There are ongoing preparations and a new program is expected to start shortly.
- **Active**  
  There is a running beta program, new builds are released regularly and we're actively working on it and collecting user feedback. 
- **Paused**  
  A beta program exists and has been active before, but no development is being done other than bug fixes.  
  New versions may still be posted occasionally, but these will only be about high-priority bug fixes or meant to discover regressions early.
- **Ended**  
  The program has ended.


### Program Mode

- **Continuous**  
  The beta program is continuously available and typically Active.

- **Periodic**  
  Beta testing happens during active phases with a duration of a few weeks (possibly months) which are interrupted by Paused periods.

- **On-Demand**  
  Members are on standby, ready for testing a new release when needed.  
  This is typically used with small, private groups.

### Communication

  All communication and interaction with the beta members is done publicly, usually in the forums.
- **Private**
  The program is conducted privately, in most cases through a private GitHub repository.

### Enrollment Method

  The program is free for everybody to join, but users need to register through our beta portal.
- **Application**
  Interested users need to apply on our beta site, often needing to fill out forms with information about their available hardware, software and environment.  
  Grant or denial of access to the program is at the sole discretion of Emby LLC.  
- **None** 
  There is no enrollment requirement and in turn, there is also no joining procedure and no membership status.
