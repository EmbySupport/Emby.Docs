You can purchase a Premiere membership in one of three intervals:
 
* **Monthly** - This will be a recurring monthly subscription that will charge to whichever payment method you choose each month and keep your Premiere status as long as these charges are current.
* **One Year** - This is a Premiere membership that will be good for one year from the date of purchase.  It will not automatically renew so you will need to re-purchase it at the end of that one year.
* **Lifetime** - This membership will be valid for the entire life of the Emby product.

Note that the standard Emby Premiere license is for single household use and has certain [limits](Is-there-a-limit-to-Emby-Premiere).  We find 95%+ of our users only need this standard license.
