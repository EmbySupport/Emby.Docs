## How to Contribute

### Create an Issue

The recommended way is to [Submit a new Issue](https://github.com/EmbySupport/Emby.Docs/issues/new/choose) in this repository.

It's easier for us when you use the links at the bottom of the support pages named "Submit Feedback on this Article". This allows us to easily correlate your feedback to the right article.

### Suggest an Edit

You can also suggest a change to an article by editing it directly here on GitHub and submitting it as a Pull Request.

Please note though, that your PR might not be merged but re-written by us instead. Use PRs only when it makes it easier for you to convey your suggested change, like for example to indicate a typo directly instead of writing a long explanation about where you have seen it exactly.
