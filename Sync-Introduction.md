The Downloads and Sync feature is an [Emby Premiere](Emby-Premiere.md) feature offering users and server admins the ability to copy media at specific resolutions and bit rates to devices for offline playback or to server folders for backup or streaming alternate versions. The use of server folders requires the installation of the [Folder Sync](Folder-Sync.md) plugin.

See [Download Options](Sync.md) for full details.

Depending on user access rights and the media type, different options for download are presented within the emby client apps to the users to either download media to the device or to another device or to a target folder. You can choose a specific media file, a complete TV Show or a season or even a whole library for download or convert or copy to a predefined [Folder Sync](Folder-Sync.md) folder. Options are provided to set the required quality and Emby will prepare/convert the media to the format requested, before copying it to the destination.

A popular use of Downloads, is picking a few movies or TV Shows and download this content to a mobile device. This allows them to then playback this media "offline". See [Offline Access](Offline-Access.md).

When using [Folder Sync](Folder-Sync.md), the media that is copied to the target folder would appear as alternative versions to the original media file.

Emby Server admin users have overall control of all download and synced media for all devices and all users.
