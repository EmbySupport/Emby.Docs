## Live TV
Primary - This channel logo is the historic logo used for channels and third party plugins. On newer Emby clients it is used on light colored backgrounds.


LogoLight & LogoLightColor - This channel logo is used on dark colored backgrounds. LogoLightColor is the default logo used but options in clients may allow for use of LogoLight as well.


Here is a example of editing graphics for a Live TV station:

Here is an example screen showing some of these graphics in use:

Here is a banner view (vs coverart) view of a movie library.  Note in this picture not all movies have a banner so the primary image will be used for images without a banner.

![Imageediting6](images/server/imageediting6.png)

Here is a disc view (vs coverart) view of a movie library.  Note in this picture not all movies have a disc so the primary image will be used for images without a disc.

![Imageediting7](images/server/imageediting7.png)

Here is a logo view (vs coverart) view of a movie library.  Note in this picture not all movies have a logo so the primary image will be used for images without a logo.

![Imageediting8](images/server/imageediting8.png)

Here is a thumb view (vs coverart) view of a movie library.  Note in this picture not all movies have a thumb so the primary image will be used for images without a thumb.
