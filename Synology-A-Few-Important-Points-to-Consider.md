* SSH access to your NAS is not required for normal installation or use of Emby Server.

* We will never ask you to login to your NAS as 'root' via SSH.

* For support purposes we might ask you to SSH to your NAS as 'admin'.

* Any procedures we might ask you to run via SSH will be documented here, not on the forum.
