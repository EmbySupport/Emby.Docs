Installing a notification service is just like any other Plugin. After installation, most notification services will require configuration of accounts or devices. For more information on installing and configuring Plugins, see [Plugins](Plugins).

## Configuring Notifications

After choosing the notification services you'd like to use, it's time to configure the individual notifications you'd like to receive. Begin by opening the server dashboard and navigating to **Notifications**.

The page will display the available notifications, as well as their current status:
