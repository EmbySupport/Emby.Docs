* If you have a current **Monthly** subscription and wish to upgrade to either a One Year or Lifetime membership, simply [cancel](How-do-I-cancel-an-Emby-Premiere-subscription) the monthly recurring payment and then, just before or after the current subscription period expires, purchase the new membership you would like.

* If you have a current **One Year** membership and wish to upgrade to Lifetime, you do not need to cancel anything as the One Year subscription does not automatically renew.  Simply purchase the Lifetime subscription at any point before or after your current term expires and your key will upgrade automatically (be sure to provide the same email address as the previous subscription).
