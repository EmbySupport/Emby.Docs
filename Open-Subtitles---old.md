Once registered, enter the username and password in the form above and click Save.

To manage subtitle downloading, click on a library in [Emby library setup](Library-Setup#subtitles), and edit the subtitle downloading settings.

Subtitles will now be downloaded as needed when available, via the Download Subtitles [Scheduled Task](Scheduled-tasks).

Note: Emby also supports other subtitle providers. You can always find the latest list in the [Plugins](Plugins) Catalog.
