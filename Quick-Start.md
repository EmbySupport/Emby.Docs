Follow these steps to set up your own Emby Server

## Prepare your media

Emby identifies your media according to folder structure, file name, and type of library to which it is assigned. Once identified, Emby downloads a rich assortment of information about your media including ratings, cast, descriptions & poster art. It can often provide other content media such as movie trailers. The combination of this information creates a very rich client experience.

The requirements for organizing and naming files are quite flexible, but will require some basic structure.

The general recommendations are:

* Separate media into appropriate folders (e.g., Movies in a "Movies" folder, TV shows in a "TV Shows" folder, music in a "Music" folder, photos in a "Photos" folder, etc.) This is covered in detail in later sections.

* Movies should be named as "Name (Year).ext", for example "Brave (2012).mp4"

* TV shows should include season and episode numbers in the name, and be stored in separate folders per show. For example: "\TV\Homeland\Season 01\Homeland s01e01.mp4"

* Music should be stored within artist and album folders, such as "\Music\Artist\Album\tracks"

## Install the Server
Once your media is named and organized, it's time to install the Server. The server is available on a number of platforms ranging from Windows to Linux, Mac, FreeBSD, NAS devices as well as media devices such as the Nvidia Shield TV.

For  more information, see [installation](Installation.md).

## Install apps on your devices

Once your installation is up and running and you've completed the startup wizard, it's time to install apps on your devices.
