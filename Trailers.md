For video files and games, trailers can be stored in the same folder as the media and named identically with a -trailer suffix.

```
/Movies
   /Home Alone (1990)
     Home Alone (1990).mkv
     Home Alone (1990)-trailer.mp4
```

Alternatively, trailers can also be stored in a trailers sub-folder. Bluray and Dvd folder rip structures must use a trailers sub-folder.

```
/Movies
   /Home Alone (1990)
     /VIDEO_TS
     /trailers
         trailer.mkv
```
