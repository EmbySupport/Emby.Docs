Yes.  However, keep in mind that the [device limit](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Wiki/wiki/Is-there-a-limit-to-Emby-Premiere) applies to the key, not a single server.  So, it will be applied across all servers using the same key.

For information on extended device plans please see: [Extended Emby Premiere Plans](https://emby.media/premiere-ext.html)
